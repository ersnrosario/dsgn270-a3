I struggled with Boolean designing. It took a lot of tinkering since I couldn't really "union" or "extract" in my head. Upon uploading the logo, it was way too big at first. Then, for each path I didnâ€™t know how to change the color, overthinking it. Then I realized that I had to use the fill portion to use color code.
